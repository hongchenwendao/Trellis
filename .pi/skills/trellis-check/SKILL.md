# Code Quality Check

Comprehensive quality verification for recently written code. Combines spec compliance, cross-layer safety, and pre-commit checks.

---

## Step 1: Identify What Changed

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD
git status
```

## Step 2: Read Task Artifacts and Applicable Specs

Read the current task artifacts in order:

- `prd.md`
- `design.md` if present
- `implement.md` if present

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages
```

For each changed package/layer, read the spec index and follow its **Quality Check** section:

```bash
cat .trellis/spec/<package>/<layer>/index.md
```

Read the specific guideline files referenced — the index is a pointer, not the goal.

## Step 3: Run Project Checks

Run the relevant project lint, type-check, and tests for the changed scope. Reuse still-valid results for unchanged code, inputs, and premises; after a change rerun affected checks. Retain the final whole-deliverable assessment and any project-required hook/CI gates. A lint pass or verbal report alone is not acceptance.

## Step 4: Review Against Checklist

### Code Quality

- [ ] Linter passes?
- [ ] Type checker passes (if applicable)?
- [ ] Tests pass?
- [ ] No debug logging left in?
- [ ] No suppressed warnings or type-safety bypasses?

### Test Coverage

- [ ] New function → unit test added?
- [ ] Bug fix → regression test added?
- [ ] Changed behavior → existing tests updated?

### Spec Sync

- [ ] Does `.trellis/spec/` need updates? (new patterns, conventions, lessons learned)

> "If I fixed a bug or discovered something non-obvious, should I document it so future me won't hit the same issue?" → If YES, update the relevant spec doc.

## Step 5: Cross-Layer Dimensions (if applicable)

Skip this step if your change is confined to a single layer.

### A. Data Flow (changes touch 3+ layers)

- [ ] Read flow traces correctly: Storage → Service → API → UI
- [ ] Write flow traces correctly: UI → API → Service → Storage
- [ ] Types/schemas correctly passed between layers?
- [ ] Errors properly propagated to caller?

### B. Code Reuse (modifying constants, creating utilities)

- [ ] Searched for existing similar code before creating new?
  ```bash
  grep -r "pattern" src/
  ```
- [ ] If 2+ places define same value → extracted to shared constant?
- [ ] After batch modification, all occurrences updated?

### C. Import/Dependency (creating new files)

- [ ] Correct import paths (relative vs absolute)?
- [ ] No circular dependencies?

### D. Same-Layer Consistency

- [ ] Other places using the same concept are consistent?

## Step 6: Report and Fix

Report every material finding you find. Then:

- Within the confirmed goal, external behavior, interface, key design, acceptance, and authorized scope → fix directly, including technical judgments, then rerun affected checks.
- A changed public contract, acceptance criterion, key design, scope, or permission → pause the affected work and report evidence, impact, attempts, and a recommended adjustment. Continue independent work. After confirmation, update the original task's superseded decision and affected steps.
- An independent reviewer, when assigned, focuses on omissions, design drift, and integration risk; make small fixes within the assigned write scope and return substantial rework to the original executor. Count review as independent only after a different executor returns actual findings. If no such result exists, report it as pending or unavailable rather than presenting self-check as independent review.

If a fix needs wider authority, do not widen it silently. Continue useful diagnosis when new evidence offers a next step; report an unchanged impasse rather than repeating the same failed approach.
